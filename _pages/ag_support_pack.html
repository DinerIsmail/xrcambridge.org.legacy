excerpt: Congratulations! You have become an Affinity Group Coordinator. We (the Affinity Group support team) are here to help you in this role and answer your questions. We can be contacted on xr_cam_ag_support_wg@protonmail.com
---

<p>In this support pack, we have provided information about:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Communication Channels</li>
	<li>Receiving Information</li>
	<li>Where are actions listed?</li>
	<li>How to start getting your AG involved</li>
	<li>A list of working groups (coming soon)</li>
	<li>What to do at your AG meetings</li>
	<li>How to plan your own action</li>
</ul>

<h1>Communication Channels</h1>
<h2>Within your Affinity Group</h2>

<p>
	We recommend that Signal is used for all chats, rather than WhatsApp. The two
	apps are very similar (and Signal is free to download) but signal is more
	secure than WhatsApp. Some groups choose to have a WhatsApp chat for
	non-sensitive information and a separate Signal chat for sensitive
	information. However, this is likely to end up becoming complicated so we
	recommend that you keep everything on Signal.
</p>
<p>
	It is good practice to set the “disappearing messages” to 1 week, so that
	sensitive information regularly disappears from people’s phones.
</p>

<h2>Communicating with other Affinity Groups</h2>
<p>
	You will be added to the Affinity Group coordinator signal chat. This is a
	group for all the affinity group coordinators to chat, ask questions, ask for
	help and share information. If there is anything you’re not sure about, this
	should be your first point of contact.
</p>

<h2>Telegram and WhatsApp Announcements channels</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		We are encouraging people to join the XR Cambridge Telegram channel rather
		than our WhatsApp channels. There is a link on xrcambridge.org to join the
		telegram channel.
	</li>
	<li>
		At the moment (as of Feb 2020) there are 2 WhatsApp announcement channels
		(because there are too many people for one channel) and 1 Telegram channel
		(Telegram has a much higher capacity). The three channels should all have
		identical messages on.
	</li>
	<li>
		There are a lot of people on these announcement channels, and only admins
		can post. As an AG coordinator, you should be an admin (if you’re not, then
		let us know)
	</li>
	<li>
		XR actions can be announced here, with up to one reminder. To post about an
		action, you should include a title which you can make bold by putting
		*asterisks* around it, followed by the date, time, location and a short
		description.
	</li>
	<li>
		Call-outs for resources/people/help can be announced here, e.g. “I am
		collecting plastic bottles for an action, please let me know if you have
		any” followed by contact details.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can also send details of the announcement to xrcambridge@gmail.com and
		specify that it is an announcement for the Affinity Group bulletin and/or
		for the email newsletter. You can also share with other Affinity Group
		coordinators in the AG signal chat.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sensitive Information</h2>
<p>
	Sensitive information should NOT be shared on WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook,
	Twitter, Instagram or any other social media platform. It should only be
	shared within signal, and ideally with “disappearing messages” turned on. This
	could include names and contact details of XR members, and plans for actions
	that are not yet public.
</p>

<hr />
<h1>Receiving Information</h1>
You will receive information from two places:
<ul>
	<li>The AG bulletin (this is the main source)</li>
	<li>The AG coordinators Signal chat</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It is up to you how you pass on this information, and we recommend that you
	have a discussion with the rest of your group to decide how to do it. These
	are some suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Get hold of everyone’s email addresses and just forward the bulletin to
		everyone each time you receive it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Go through the bulletin yourself, pick out the bits that you think are
		relevant to your group and then send these out either by email or on your
		group’s signal chat.
	</li>
	<li>
		Wait until your next AG meeting and then use the bulletin points as agenda
		points, or read out the bulletin at the meeting.
	</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h1>Where are actions listed?</h1>
Hopefully, if everything has gone according to plan, actions and events should
be announced:
<ul>
	<li>On the website: https://xrcambridge.org/events</li>
	<li>On facebook</li>
	<li>On the WhatsApp announcements channel</li>
	<li>On the email newsletter (not all actions will go out here)</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h1>How to start getting your AG involved</h1>
Here are 4 suggestions of ways to get involved:
<ul>
	<li>
		Get a wad of leaflets from the office and take your AG out leafleting (email
		office.xrcam@protonmail.com)
	</li>
	<li>
		Look out on the above channels to see what actions are happening, and go out
		together to one of the actions. You don’t need to take your whole AG, anyone
		can go to an action, but it’s a good bonding experience if you can go
		together.
	</li>
	<li>
		Plan your own action! A new action support working group is currently being
		set up who can support you with this - more info coming soon. Remember that
		Extinction Rebellion is made up of autonomous groups, so as long as you plan
		an action that fits with the 10 principles and values
		(https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/), you don’t need to get
		anyone’s permission.
	</li>
	<li>
		Get your AG members to start joining working groups. The working group
		structure is in the process of changing, and some of the groups you can see
		on the website (https://xrcambridge.org/get_involved) might be changing -
		watch this space. But in general, to join a working group, just send them an
		email.
	</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h1>What to do at your AG meetings</h1>
<p>
	It is important to meet regularly if you can. Other groups have found that it
	helps to pick a regular time (e.g. every-other-monday) for simplicity.
</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for how to structure your meeting:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Start with a check-in. Go round in a circle and let people talk about what
		they’ve been up to, how they are feeling, what’s on their mind. Make sure
		that people are not interrupted whilst they are speaking. You could choose
		to set a time limit, or not. Some groups do very short check-ins (just a few
		words or sentences), others like to do long check-ins (5+ minutes each).
		It’s completely up to you.
	</li>
	<li>
		Structure the meeting with an agenda of points that you want to discuss.
		These could be other actions that you’ve heard about, tactics, rebellions,
		working groups, your own action ideas etc etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		If there are a lot of agenda points, prioritise and/or assign time limits to
		each one.
	</li>
	<li>
		If there are a lot of people in your AG, you might need to use the hand
		signals to make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak and people don’t
		interrupt each other.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hand signals and letting everyone speak</h2>
Many XR meetings are facilitated using hand signals so that everyone gets a
chance to speak and people do not talk over each other. Here is a list of the
main hand signals:
<ul>
	<li>Hand up: “I want to speak - please put me in the queue”</li>
	<li>
		Two fingers up: “Direct point - I want to skip the queue and respond
		immediately”
	</li>
	<li>T-symbol with hands: “Technical point”</li>
	<li>C-symbol with fingers: “Clarification point”</li>
	<li>Waving both hands - agreement</li>
	<li>P - shape - proposal (to resolve a discussion possibly).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zoom</h2>
<p>
	If you can’t meet in person or just prefer not to, you could meet on zoom. You
	can create a free account which allows meetings for up to 40 minutes (you can
	always re-click the link). Or you can contact the systems and tech working
	group to get the zoom login details for our paid Cambridge XR account.
</p>
<p>
	There is also a similar platform called Jitsi but it’s not as widely used.
</p>

<h1>How to plan your own action</h1>
<p>
	Here are some resources from the Action Support Working group. They are there
	to help you with your action, answer your questions, give you guidance and
	help you with practicalities. They can be contacted on
	xrcamactionsupport@protonmail.com

		involved.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggested actions:</h2>
If you need some inspiration, here are some ideas (the Actions Support working
group can give you more help and guidance):

<ul>
	<li>Swarming (temporary road blocks)</li>
	<li>Leafleting (no risk of arrest)</li>
	<li>A static road block (e.g. for 1 hour)</li>
	<li>A banner drop (e.g. drop a banner from a bridge)</li>
	<li>
		A performative action, e.g. big banners, music or flash dance in a public
		space
	</li>
	<li>
		Occupying a space, e.g. a bank that invests in fossil fuels or a petrol
		station, or the entrance to a college that has links with fossil fuels, or a
		talk that promotes fossil fuel use etc.
	</li>
</ul>
