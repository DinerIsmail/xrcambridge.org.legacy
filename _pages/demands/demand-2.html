<p class="demand-text">must hold a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Justice.</p>
<p><i>(more info and references coming soon)</i></p>
<p>
	Disadvantaged and marginalised communities will experience the effects of the
	climate crisis most severely. For example, World Health Organisation research
	shows that women, children, socially isolated people and the elderly are
	affected more severely by climate-related food insecurity. Any attempt to
	address the climate crisis must seek to bring justice to these communities.
</p>

<p>
	The current democratic system has failed to deliver this. We need a radically
	inclusive form of democracy. We must place decision-making power into the
	hands of those who have been pushed aside by the system. In response to
	Extinction Rebellion’s third national demand councils across the country have
	introduced Citizens’ Assemblies. However, since they are only advisory they
	lack any power to bring about change.
</p>

<p>To meet this demand, the City Council must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Establish a Citizens’ Assembly on Climate Justice.</li>
	<li>
		Ensure that marginalised groups are well represented in the Assembly. This
		must include those without citizenship status in the UK.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ensure that the expert panel includes:
		<ul>
			<li>Climate scientists</li>
			<li>Health professionals</li>
			<li>Experts on decolonisation and climate justice</li>
			<li>People who have lived on the front lines of the climate crisis</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Exclude from the panel those who directly profit from the exploitation of
		workers, the Global South, or natural resources.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ensure that the Citizens’ Assembly has significant decision-making powers
		and a binding mandate.
	</li>
	<li>Act urgently on the decisions of the Citizens’ Assembly.</li>
</ul>
