      <p>
        We are now announcing the location of our week-long roadblock: The roundabout on Trumpington Road intersecting with Fen Causeway in Cambridge City Centre!
      </p>
      <img width="200" src="../assets/images/r4j-location.jpg" alt="Rebel for Justice site location map" />
      <p>
        The location has been specifically chosen to target the three institutions we have issued demands of: The University of Cambridge, Cambridge City Council, and Cambridgeshire County Council. This site will heavily disrupt Cambridge's road network.
      </p>
      <p>The site will become a base for more disruptive satellite actions to take place all across Cambridge, and the roadblock itself will be a place of peace, learning, and above all a commitment to social and climate justice.</p>
      <p>There will be a different theme for satellite actions on each day of the rebellion. These are: </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Sunday 16th - A Space For Justice.</b> We’ll be setting up our home for the week - a creative space focused on our shared vision for change.</li>
        <li><b>Monday 17th - Whose Earth?</b> Monday’s actions and activities will be focused on land exploitation and its impacts.</li>
        <li><b>Tuesday 18th - Fossil Fools.</b> Our focus for Tuesday is on harmful extractivism.</li>
        <li><b>Wednesday 19th - The Road to Climate Catastrophe.</b> This day will be focused on transport justice.</li>
        <li><b>Thursday 20th - Another World is Possible.</b> On Thursday, we’ll focus on highlighting the inequalities in our city and region, and creating a vision for a more just society.</li>
        <li><b>Friday 21st - Dear World… Yours, Cambridge.</b> Friday’s actions will call attention to Cambridge’s place in an unjust world.</li>
        <li><b>Saturday 22nd and Sunday 23rd - Time is Running Out.</b> As we call this week of rebellion to a close, we will look to the future and our part in it.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More information, including an information pack and details on some of the satellite actions will be coming very soon! Until then, make sure to join the <a href="https://t.me/s/rebel_for_justice">Telegram chat</a>.</p>

<h2>Our three demands are:</h2>
<div class="gridMaker threeDemands">
	<a class="demand-image" href="/university-demand"><img src="../assets/images/demand-1.jpg" /></a>
	<a class="demand-image" href="/city-council-demand"><img src="../assets/images/demand-2.jpg" /></a>
	<a class="demand-image" href="/county-council-demand"><img src="../assets/images/demand-3.jpg" /></a>
</div>

<h2>Climate Justice Is Social Justice</h2>
<p>
	The effects of the climate and ecological emergency are falling more heavily
	on disadvantaged and marginalised communities around the world, including in
	the UK. Any attempt to address the climate crisis must seek to bring justice
	to these communities.
</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>
	The City and County Councils have declared a climate emergency – yet business
	as usual continues. Cambridge University has accepted that it must divest from
	fossil fuels, yet remains deeply entwined with the fossil fuel industry.
</p>
<p>
	Starting on 1st January, XR will engage in a series of non-violent actions to
	put pressure on local government and Cambridge University. If our three
	demands are not met, we will form a roadblock in central Cambridge, causing
	major disruption in the city. This will put more pressure on these
	institutions to act, and highlight their inaction so far. It will also be a
	place of peace, learning, and above all a commitment to social and climate
	justice.
</p>

<h2>
	Why is the struggle for climate justice also a struggle for social justice?
</h2>
<p>
	As the first country to industrialise, the UK bears a huge historic
	responsibility for the climate and environmental crisis. Our exploitation of
	the natural world goes hand in hand with our exploitation of communities
	around the globe and our history of colonialism and capitalism.
</p>
<p>
	Today, it is the poorest and most marginalised people in the world who are
	bearing the brunt of climate catastrophe – which results largely from the
	actions of the most wealthy. Here in the UK, it is the least advantaged who
	suffer most from the effects of flooding, summer heatwaves and air pollution.
</p>
<p>
	Institutions like Cambridge University bear great historic responsibility for
	the climate crisis and have huge power to reduce the effects of environmental
	crisis and climate injustice. Despite their power, they act too slowly or not
	at all.
</p>
<p>
	Local government too has the power to change things radically and rapidly - by
	standing up to central government inaction and austerity, but also by using
	their powers now to tackle the emergencies we face in a socially just way.
