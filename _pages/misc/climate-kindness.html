<p>Over the next 4 weeks, we invite everyone to do these 3 things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Climate</li>
  <li>Create</li>
  <li>Community</li>
</ul>

<div class="ck-green">
  <h1>Climate</h1>

  <p>Donate an hour’s wage or an hour of your time (or both!) to XR Cambridge:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To donate: <a href="https://xrcambridge.org/donate">xrcambridge.org/donate</a></li>
    <li>To see what tasks need doing <a href="https://xrcambridge.org/roles">xrcambridge.org/roles</a></li>
    <li>Or you can donate to XR UK <a href="https://rebellion.earth/donate">rebellion.earth/donate</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We can’t demonstrate in public but it doesn’t mean we’re not busy. We still need money for ongoing things like storage space, and to keep our technology and our people going! There is a lot of work happening behind the scenes to build the movement. When we’re not visible, it’s harder to raise money and recruit volunteers, so please help us out! Send us a donation, look through the list of specific tasks that need doing, or browse the working groups to see if there’s one that matches your interests.</p>

</div>

<div class="ck-blue">
  <h1>Create</h1>

  <p>Write a haiku, draw, paint, cook, make, grow, play, sing… and share it!</p>

  <p>Try something you wouldn’t normally do - inspire someone else to get creative. Cook something and then share the recipe. Whatever you can do, share it online with the hashtag <b>#ClimateKindness</b> to share the creative spirit!</p>

  <p>If you have an original idea or something that worked well, please share it with us by using the hashtag <b>#ClimateKindness</b></p>

</div>

<div class="ck-pink">
  <h1>Community</h1>

  <p>We all need to help each other in whatever ways we can - volunteer, donate, support, chat… and ask for help if you need it.</p>

  <p>We will be posting different suggestions for how you can help your community as the campaign goes on. Look out for ones that fit your skillset, or challenge yourself to do something out of your comfort zone. If you try something that makes you smile, share it online with the hashtag <b>#ClimateKindness</b></p>

  <p>If you have ideas for community acts that other people can do, or are part of a group that needs extra help, please post on social media with the hashtag <b>#ClimateKindness</b> and we will repost.</p>
