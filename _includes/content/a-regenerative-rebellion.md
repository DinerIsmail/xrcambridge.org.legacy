Regenerative Culture seeks to bring a different approach to climate and other activist movement. It is how we move towards a practice and demonstration of the change we want to experience in this and all society. Its purpose is to nurture a new culture that is resilient and robust and which can support us all through the changes we must inevitably face together. Regenerative Culture precedes, holds us through and lasts beyond the actions that we take as part of our rebellion.
Below are some resources, both inspirational and practical.

# Inspiration

#### How Can We Practise Regenerative Action?

Essential viewing for activists! Two Buddhist monks from Plum Village, peace-activist Thich Naht Hahn's centre in France, visited the Extinction Rebellion action in London in April 2019. Here they speak with a member of XR about how mindful awareness can give the energy needed for regenerative action. Truly inspiring!
