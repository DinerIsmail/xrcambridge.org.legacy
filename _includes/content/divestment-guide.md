## How to provide proof of divestment commitments

Our email for everything to do with our divestment campaign is [xryouthcambridge@protonmail.com](mailto:xryouthcambridge@protonmail.com)

In [our demands](/university-divestment), we listed several unethical and ecocidal industries and
 criteria for companies to divest from. For us to classify you as being either partially or fully divested from a given ecocidal industry/company, the following are needed:

1. An official public statement/announcement of your decision/position/policy, which includes:
    * What you are divesting from (for example for fossil fuels, is this all
     fossil fuels or just e.g. tar sands?)
    * Whether your college:
        * Never held direct/indirect investments at all
        * Decided to divest previously but didn't announce it publicly
        * Are making a new divestment commitment
    * The date you commit to finishing the divestment process by
    * Why you are divesting
    * Any other information you think is relevant (e.g. perhaps you have decided
     to engage your pension provider to ask that they also divest, or maybe you'd like to also declare a climate and ecological emergency)

2. A page/post on your website detailing the same details as above in perpetuity. It must:
    * Be easily accessible to the public, students, and staff
    * Show up in your website's search results for the keywords 'divest' or
     'divestment', and the category of investment you are divesting from (e.g. 'fossil fuels')
    * Not disappear at any point unless your website is under maintenance

3. A notification sent to our email address (see top of the page) providing links to the above
 
Your college can announce divestment from each industry/company one-by-one, or announce a number of them togther. Other forms of proof of divestment
 may be accepted on a case-by-case basis - please email us if you have any questions or concerns.

Once you have satisfied these criteria, we will:

1. Update our categorisation of your college
2. De-prioritise your college in our non-violent direct action (NVDA) campaign, instead focusing on other colleges that have not made as much progress as yours. If you have committed to fully divesting, we will remove you from
  the NVDA campaign entirely!
3. Make an announcement of your college's progress

If you have good reason for us not to make a specific announcement about your college's progress, please email us so we can discuss this.


## Divestment categories

For each category of ecocidal industry/company we have listed in [our demands](/university-divestment), your college will fit into one of the following criteria. For example, you can be fully divested from fossil fuels but non-divested from arms. To meet [our demands](/university-divestment) fully, you must be fully divested from all industries/companies listed.

**Non-divested**

In the given ecocidal industry/company, your college:
* Holds direct investments
* Has no commitments to partially or fully divest, or to never hold
 investments again

**Committed to partially divest**

Your college is non-divested, but has committed to fulfil the criteria of partial divestment by a certain date.

**Partially divested**

In the given ecocidal industry/company, your college:
* Holds no direct investments (i.e. only holds indirect investments)
* Has committed to never hold direct investments again

**Committed to fully divest**

Your college is non-divested or partially divested, but has committed to
 fulfil the criteria of full divestment by a certain date.

**Fully divested**

In the given ecocidal industry/company, your college:
* Holds no direct or indirect investments
* Has committed to never hold direct or indirect investments again
