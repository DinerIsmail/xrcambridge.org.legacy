**XR MCR** is hosting a four-day peaceful action in Manchester from Friday August 30th. We invite you to join us and rebels from across the region in Northern Rebellion.

Rebels will hold a peaceful space in the city centre to create a wonderful oasis of social change, creativity and action.

With three days of music, art, trainings, talks, assemblies, food, wellbeing and workshops, it’s a chance to meet others, learn new skills, draw strength from each other - and take non-violent direct action in response to the continued inaction on our terrible ecological crisis. 💚🌍

There will be some brilliant speakers such as ecological economics expert Julia Steinberger, one of the authors of the Intergovernmental Panel Of Climate Change’s landmark 2018 report - as well as DJs, bands and performers from all over the region, including our very own samba band, and some surprise special guests…
See below for further details of the event 👇

Invoking the rallying cry of those other Manchester rebels, the suffragettes, who told us _"Deeds not Words"_, we urge people to Act Now - and join the Northern Rebellion!

_XR rebels occupy a bridge in Leeds as part of Project Mushroom action in July 2019._

The Northern Rebellion is part of XR’s Rebel Rising series - a number of gatherings across the UK this August and September building momentum to a Greta Thunberg-led Earth Strike from 20-27th September and a second big National XR action in London (from Monday 7th October).

> On October 7th we’re going to shut down London like never before. And to build up to this historic moment we’re holding massive regional gatherings to celebrate, train and prepare.

Not a week goes by without more evidence of the climate catastrophe we are wreaking, from Arctic wildfires to the increasingly extreme weather in the UK - this July seeing record heat followed by record floods in just a few days.

So it’s vital we keep up the pressure on government because after decades of broken commitments and with global carbon emissions still rising, the only way to ensure leaders take action is through peaceful direct action and disobedience.

It is essential that we Act Now! Join the **#NorthernRebellion**.

### WHEN IS THE NORTHERN REBELLION?

- Fri Aug 30th - Mon 2nd Sept or Tues 3rd Sept.

- There will be three days of music, talks, training, nourishing and learning (Fri 30th - Sun 1st); followed by a day or two of action.

### WHERE WILL IT BE?

The Northern Rebellion will take place in Manchester city centre in an outside space, where rebels will assemble for the duration of the event.

The exact location will be widely publicised nearer the time including via the XR MCR newsletter.

## REBEL SCHOOL

💚🌍🎤📖📈👀

We’ll host talks and training from both Extinction Rebellion and external experts, telling the truth about the ecological breakdown we face.

And showing the facts about the impact it is having on global communities, and our natural world, right now.

New and existing rebels will be able to get skilled up in all key areas, including Non-Violent Direct Action and Well-being and Regenerative Culture.

A few of the individuals and groups coming to talk at #NorthernRebellion are:
Julia Steinberger
Seeds for Change
Climate Refugees Welcome Here
Also
Solutions Zone - innovative solutions to the problems we face
Rebel Inductions - find out about XR and join the movement
Heading for Extinction and What to Do About it talk

There are many more, some more widely known than others - keep your ears open for news about headline acts and guests over the course of the weekend.

We’ll also hold People’s Assemblies every day to decide how the action proceeds as well as on specific topics such as political change and ideas / feedback for XR’s October action.

To volunteer a talk or space for your group please email [northernxr@gmail.com](mailto:northernxr@gmail.com?subject=REBEL%20SCHOOL) with _REBEL SCHOOL_ as the subject.

### CAN I HELP WITH THE NORTHERN REBELLION?

Yes please! As with all XR actions and events, ‘we’re all crew’ and work in a non-hierarchical, de-centralised way.
The rebellion is being organised by volunteers - the event is entirely designed and decided by those who work on it.

If you have an idea - come and make it happen!
Anyone is welcome to get involved, both in planning / jobs at the event / packing down.

**To summarise:**

- To volunteer/let us know you are coming - please [sign up here](https://forms.gle/gvoDrcJZQnDrGfSm8).
- To volunteer an act please complete our [performer form here](https://forms.gle/RtVXWL8odzYBSXL56).
- To volunteer a talk or have space for your group, email [northernxr@gmail.com](mailto:northernxr@gmail.com?subject=REBEL%20SCHOOL), subject: _REBEL SCHOOL_.

### SHOULD I COME TO THE NORTHERN REBELLION?

Yes please! The Northern Rebellion is for anyone that wants to understand more about ecological breakdown or Extinction Rebellion’s role in calling for change.

For those that are new to the global crisis, or the XR movement, there will be talks from climate and ecological experts around the North, as well as introductory trainings to help you get involved and actions to put training into practice.

For those that have been involved in the movement over recent months, it is a chance for action, building our knowledge and skills, discussion about how we can collaborate and move forward in the North, and much more.

### DO I HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF XR TO ATTEND?

Not at all! The event is free and open to anyone and is a great way to learn about XR and see if it is right for you.
The Northern Rebellion isn’t just for those that are already involved in an XR group in the North: it is for anyone that is concerned about the current situation or that wants to understand more.

We just ask that when you join the space or an action, you respect our principles, which include non-violence at all times. The space itself will be completely drink and drug free.

### WILL IT BE FAMILY FRIENDLY?

There will be a family-friendly area of the space, and activities over the weekend. If you’d like to get involved in organising or have any ideas, please email [northernxr@gmail.com](mailto:northernxr@gmail.com?subject=FAMILY) with _FAMILY_ in the subject line or contact Manchester Rising Up! Families on Facebook.

### WHERE CAN I STAY?

There are several options:-

- **Rebel Camp** - outside at the Northern rebellion space; Please bring a tent, sleeping bag/mat and everything else you feel you need for a night outside. (Please be aware there is a small legal risk with camping out as this will be an ‘unauthorised’ event. All rebels will be briefed in advance and we will be liaising with police throughout)

- **Limited indoor accommodation** - we have around 120 spaces for rebels inside at three main venues - you’ll still need a sleeping bag/mat/pillow but these spaces offer a more comfy place to bed down with indoor toilets.

- **Rebel B&B** - Manchester-based rebels have offered to provide accommodation for people from outside Manchester. A great way to make new friends across the North!

If you have a particular accommodation need, please let us know here.

We will not be able to host everyone in our indoor spaces, so if you don’t wish to camp or want to ensure some quiet space away from the centre and you have friends or family in Manchester, it may be worth getting in touch with them.

### HOW CAN I GET THERE?

Central Manchester is easily accessible by train to Piccadilly, Victoria, Oxford Road and Deansgate, as well as coach.

XR groups from around the North will also be organising travel from various locations.

If you are interested in this option, please fill in our [sign up form](https://forms.gle/gvoDrcJZQnDrGfSm8).

Unfortunately, the Northern Rebellion team will not be able to cover costs for people attending, but it may be worth talking to your local group if you need support with costs.

### WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

If you are camping on site or staying in our accommodation you will need - a sleeping bag, mat (and tent if on site), and your own personal items including phone and spare battery, weather protection (sun or rain!) etc.

We will be sending out a full information pack closer to the time.

Register your interest with our [sign up form](https://forms.gle/gvoDrcJZQnDrGfSm8) to receive the pack and other updates.

### WHERE CAN I FIND THE SCHEDULE?

Plans for the Northern Rebellion are still in progress (and waiting for your ideas!).

We will release a schedule nearer the time which we will publish online, although this is likely to be subject to change.

Please register your interest with our [sign up form](https://forms.gle/gvoDrcJZQnDrGfSm8) in order to receive an information pack and further updates.

### WILL I BE AT RISK OF ARREST?

The Northern Rebellion is a low risk event. There will be stewards and volunteers to manage the space.
Rebels who camp in the space are at a higher risk although we will be carrying out full police liaison in advance.

No one will be under pressure to take ‘arrestable’ action, and there will be full days of talks, training, and meeting other rebels for those that do not wish to take part in higher risk forms of civil disobedience.

All direct action comes with some risk of arrest so we advise you to read the [Legals section of XR’s website](https://rebellion.earth/act-now/resources/legal-info/), if you want to understand more.

**Advance Training:**

There is a workshop on ‘Police Tactics and How to Stay Safe’ being held in Manchester on August 11th (aimed at rebels wanting to take more risky action at future actions, or just those interested to know more).

There is training for people who would like to become Legal Observers, in central Manchester on August 18th.
(No experience necessary, legal observers act as neutral parties during an action and record what is done and said).

### WHY IS IT IN MANCHESTER?

Climate change is affecting us all. And the whole of the UK will need to change its approach if we are to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2025. Northern councils control everything from local transport and roads to council pension funds. Local MPs also have a significant voice in Westminster. The Northern Rebellion is a chance for them to see that their constituents are serious about the need for urgent change and are calling on them to act now.

### WHAT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE DISRUPTED?

We would not disrupt members of the public if it were not absolutely necessary and we acknowledge the inconvenience we may cause. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that we have less that 12 years to make drastic changes, if we are to limit climate catastrophe. We believe that non-violent direct action is the only way to persuade the government to take the absolutely urgent action required.

### WHAT ABOUT EMERGENCY VEHICLES?

We will be working with police in coming weeks to ensure that alternative routes are in place so any emergency vehicles can get through.
