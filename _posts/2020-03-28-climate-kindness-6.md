Nonamekitchen is an NGO providing food for refugees in Serbia - [nonamekitchen.org/en/](https://www.nonamekitchen.org/en/)
It’s important to remember that this vital aid continues - and must continue - in the face of any crisis. Right now, volunteers have had to leave and the locals have stepped in and taken over the kitchen. They’re still getting the food out. **<3**
