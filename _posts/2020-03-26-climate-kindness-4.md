Today we’re suggesting that you GET CREATIVE and put a rainbow in your window. Rainbows symbolise hope - if you see a rainbow in someone’s window you know they’re thinking about you. You might have seen some out and about already.

What kind of rainbow will you make? Once it’s in your window, take a photo and share it on social media with #ClimateKindness
