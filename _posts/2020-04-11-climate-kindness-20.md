Today we’re raising awareness of another amazing charity - the Red Hen Project, which supports kids in five schools in North Cambridge and aims to help break cycles of poverty. You can donate to them here: [redhenproject.charitycheckout.co.uk/profile](https://redhenproject.charitycheckout.co.uk/profile) or follow them on social media to find out about donations of stuff needed for their activity packs!
