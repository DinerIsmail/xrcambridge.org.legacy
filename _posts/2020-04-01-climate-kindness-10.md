Today we are encouraging you to GET CREATIVE with a bit of cooking or baking! Pick a recipe you’ve never tried before and see how it turns out - if it’s successful, share the recipe on social media with **#ClimateKindness**. If it’s not successful we still want to see a photo!!!

Some ideas:
* EASY: crispy cakes: melt chocolate and mix in rice krispies or cornflakes
* MEDIUM: vegan cupcakes
* HARD: sourdough bread
