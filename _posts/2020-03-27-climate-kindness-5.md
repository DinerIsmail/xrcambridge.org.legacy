Today would normally be a Youth Strike day. We can’t go out and protest, but we can still spread the message! Make a placard about the climate emergency - take a selfie of yourself with your placard to share on social media with **#ClimateKindness**.

Suggested placard messages:
**#ClimateKindness**
**#FridaysForFuture**
