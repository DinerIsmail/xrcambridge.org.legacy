Today, we would like to encourage you to donate blood if you’re able. If you can’t, please share this request with others. Don’t forget to share on social media with #ClimateKindness

As the coronavirus pandemic grows in the UK, fewer and fewer people will be able to donate blood. Already, blood donation is down 15%, and this is likely to increase as the outbreak worsens. However, it will still be desperately needed, including for people in intensive care. Blood donation counts as essential travel, and centres remain open throughout the country. There are coronavirus guidelines available at [https://my.blood.co.uk/KnowledgeBase/Index/coronavirus](https://my.blood.co.uk/KnowledgeBase/Index/coronavirus)

If you are in Cambridge, there is information about where you can donate at [https://www.blood.co.uk/the-donation-process/about-our-donation-venues/cambridge-donor-centre/](https://www.blood.co.uk/the-donation-process/about-our-donation-venues/cambridge-donor-centre/)

If you are elsewhere, there is information where to find your local donation centre at [https://my.blood.co.uk/](https://my.blood.co.uk/)

In calling for people within XR and our broader communities to donate blood, we are returning to XR Youth Cambridge’s first sister action (“Give Back: Give Blood”), which we created in recognition of the relationship between climate crisis and systematic inequalities. Sister actions disrupt the system through the redistribution of privilege. In a crisis where the most marginalised and vulnerable people in our society are being affected the first and worst, this is more urgent and important than ever.
