Today we’re looking at Climate. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that our system is fragile, but also that together we can build strong, resilient communities. Community-building is central to XR and we are continuing to grow the movement even though we can’t go out and protest.

For the climate challenge, we’re inviting you to give an hour to XR Cambridge - either by taking on a small task, or by donating an hour’s wages. Whatever help you can give will be gratefully received. Visit [xrcambridge.org/climate-kindness](/climate-kindness) to find out how to donate time or money.

Don’t forgot to post about it on social media with **#ClimateKindness**.
