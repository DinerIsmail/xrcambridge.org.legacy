Over the next 4 weeks, we invite everyone to do these 3 things:

1. Climate: Donate an hour’s wage or an hour of your time (or both!) to XR Cambridge - go to xrcambridge.org/climate-kindness
2. Create: Write a haiku, draw, paint, cook, make, grow, play, sing… and share it!
3. Community: We all need to help each other in whatever ways we can - volunteer, donate, support, chat… and ask for help if you need it.

We will be posting different ideas each day - do as much as you are able; every contribution counts. Let us know how you get on and encourage your friends by sharing on social media with the hashtag **#ClimateKindness**

For the first act of community kindness, we suggest that you join your local mutual aid groups, and support them by giving or receiving help - or both! Don’t forget to share on social media with **#ClimateKindness**

Cambridgeshire has a coronavirus mutual aid group, which can be found at [https://www.facebook.com/groups/196779265071327/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/196779265071327/)

Local mutual aid groups within Cambridgeshire can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sEMNXYgulg7X_hhFBcBYFSi0tSbf6weRWTzj4fRDr3c/edit#gid=0).

Groups across the country, along with advice and a further explanation of the need for mutual aid can be found at [covidmutualaid.org](https://covidmutualaid.org)

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the government’s prioritising of the economy over lives, mutual aid groups have sprung up across the country in recent weeks to provide grassroots community support and solidarity. This involves the voluntary giving and receiving of direct and practical help, which ranges from the delivery of food and medication to phone calls and online gatherings.

Grassroots community organising is vital in this current crisis, and will continue to be increasingly necessary as the climate and ecological crisis escalates, particularly if our government, and governments across the world, continue in their failure to act.

We hope that these groups will create the groundwork for a network of community care and collaboration to support us through the years ahead, long after this pandemic has ended.
