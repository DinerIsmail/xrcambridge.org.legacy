## A HIVE OF RECENT ACTIVITY

### XRMCR’s People’s Assembly

> People’s Assemblies are a way for a group of people to discuss issues or make decisions collectively, where all voices are heard and valued equally and no one person or group are able to dominate the process.

Last week you got the chance to make your voices heard on the direction of XRMCR. Key themes emerged on recruitment, the benefits of social/face-to–face meet ups, finding out how to get involved, as well as what’s going on in local and working groups. In the future we’ll make sure the meetings are publicised in advance and include more updates in addition to training in new skills.

Remember **we are all crew** and you’re welcome to get involved by contacting the relevant working group on our [contact page](/contact "Contact Us").

## BEE IN YOUR BONNET

**Last week Paul Harnett replied to Grahame and Elliot’s thoughts on his Cap and Dividend proposal. Here’s their response:**

_Thanks for your response. You have clarified the cap and dividend proposal, and we understand it better now. There are two sides to the proposal. The first is an absolute and global cap on production. The second is that some part of the revenue from the remaining production under the cap is set aside for a universal income. This is the dividend. You use an analogy of a tap and a sprinkler. The cap is turning down the tap. This you state is a simpler solution than blocking up all the holes on the sprinkler which represents the regulation and decarbonisation of all the industries that use fossil fuels. You tell us that turning the tap down is simply about controlling the behaviour of a small number of oil companies._

_We still have concerns. Firstly, it is not about oil companies directly - it is about nation states, and it is nation states that will negotiate any agreement for a global cap. As we said before, almost all fossil fuel extraction is by or for nations. The concerns you discuss in regard to oil companies are simply moved to the behaviours of governments. Governments support the extraction of fossil fuels because it makes them a lot of money, floats our economies and buys influence. Of course, this use of fossil resources is at the heart of our climate emergency, but many states still think it is in their interest and will fight to maintain it. The key point is that nation states won’t all agree to a universal cap. A universal cap, though very simple in principle, is not in practice. To suggest that this is the simple solution misses the point that the complexity of the ‘sprinkler' is just moved somewhere else - to a massively protracted global negotiation that the oil producing nations will stretch out as long as possible. And in line with your views, the oil companies will probably be happy to see this negotiation drawn out. These negotiations could take a lifetime - and we haven’t got that long. Even if an agreement was reached quickly through some lashed up compromise that set the cap way to high, it would be broken by producers defecting from the agreement and finding willing buyers._

_The best we can hope for is an alignment of likeminded states with high ambitions prepared to work together through beneficial agreements. And, that these relationships are seen to be successful and spread quickly to other nations._

_The second point is that even if we did go for this cap, governments will still manage change at the sprinkler. Turning the fossil fuel tap off without making lots of adjustments at the industry end would be chaos. We aren’t just making the downstream smaller - we are changing it. And the truth is that this change doesn’t happen without a lot of intervention. Perhaps it won’t be governments as we know them now. Perhaps it will be more like the world that Hazel Healy describes in the XR handbook ‘The Is Not A Drill’, but it is still a necessarily structured intervention. Just look at the power sector in the UK and the effort required to decarbonise it. That is what governments do — they regulate and direct._

_Finally, the universal income need not come from a global pot supplied by fossil fuels. It could come from any government revenues that a state chooses. Your scheme requires two very difficult things to happen together. This makes it very unlikely to succeed. It would be better to disconnect these two activities. It will be easier to get governments to buy into a universal income if it is not dependent on the success of achieving a global cap on fossil fuels._

## Climate Emergency! Where’s the Urgency?

![Climate Emergency! Where’s the Urgency?]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/newsletters/20190709/manchester-declares.jpg "Climate Emergency! Where’s the Urgency?")

With estimates of 15-50% of total emissions deriving from animal agriculture the only way to achieve XR's demand is to transition by 2025 to a Plant Based Society. In October, Animal Rebellion will take to the streets alongside XR to demand the same: that the government tells the truth about animal agriculture emissions, legislates for a plant based society by 2025, and sets up a citizens’ assembly to deliberate on how to achieve this. [Come and see a presentation](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/climate-emergency-wheres-the-urgency-free-pizza-tickets-64799935351?aff=esfb&utm-source=fb&fbclid=IwAR3GJZ5Cq3ZtWKwwZ7diDrBZRsyVxKGgAfh6fau9Hyu8uGBVvytF_Skuwn0&utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discover "Mark Lancaster Presentation") by Mark Lancaster from Animal Think Tank who is well versed in national XR strategy. Take part in the discussion - plus free vegan pizza from Zad’s. If you haven’t tried Zads, then you’re in for a treat!
