I wish I had nothing to lose.<br>
But I have everything to lose.<br>
I could lose marmite, and honey,<br>
Which my gran used to put on sandwiches together,<br>
Because she was a rebel.<br>

I might lose the happy meal toys I get cheap from charity shops,<br>
And Lego. I really like Lego.<br>
I might lose smiling at yappy dogs that think they are greyhounds<br>
All cocky and loud.<br>
I may lose my son.<br>

I may lose the smell of toast and coffee in the morning<br>
And the way that you smile at me that tells me it’s on.<br>
I might lose coffee.<br>
They tell be arabica isn’t doing so well.<br>
Fuck.<br>
I might lose coffee.<br>

I might lose nail clippers and LED lights and projectors and boxing gloves<br>
That arrive when I buy them<br>
In 24 hours.<br>
I might lose my Amazon subscription.<br>
I might lose the plants I love and the trees.<br>
We might lose the Amazon.<br>

Netflix might not be a thing<br>
YouTube might fall silent.<br>
I may lose my patience with politicians who sell weapons<br>
Whilst they tell me about how they abhor violence.<br>
I may lose my self-righteousness.<br>
I may lose my friends.<br>
I might lose the ability to speak.<br>
I might lose the ability to cry.<br>
I really hope I never lose my willingness to hold you.<br>

I might lose a world with animals in it<br>
Who are wild and untamed and awake.<br>
I might lose air that can be breathed without processing.<br>
I might lose the ability to stand in the rain<br>
Without being burnt by the acid.<br>
I might lose my strength.<br>
I might lose my empathy.<br>
I might lose my will.<br>
I might lose everything.<br>

I really hope, I really really hope,<br>
That I only lose the things<br>
And not the people.<br>
Not the life.<br>

I really hope, I really, really hope,<br>
That we can all rebel against this madness<br>
And remember what it is we need,<br>
What it is we love,<br>
And shed the rest.<br>
