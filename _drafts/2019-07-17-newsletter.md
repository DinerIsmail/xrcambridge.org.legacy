## A Momentous Day

Wednesday was a momentous day by all accounts. Not one but two climate emergency declarations in Greater Manchester. 
We cannot rest on our laurels, however. With the summer uprising in full swing we need the government to translate words 
into actions or we won’t stop fighting for our existence.

Manchester City Council unanimously declared a climate emergency last week. In an historic moment witnessed by climate 
groups, activists and citizens, Hulme Councillor Annette Wright put forward the motion by saying:

> “we need to state our intention much more forcefully and clearly than we have done already. We need to ensure that
> the issue of climate change is embedded into everything that we do and is top of our list of priorities”

Next up, Chorlton Councillor Eve Holt reminded everyone what is at stake in an passionate speech:

> “let’s be under no illusion, Climate Breakdown, and the wider ecological crisis, presents the most significant threat
> to ‘Our Fair City’ and to the safety and security of those she shelters. As well as representing the most serious 
> threat to all humanity in the entire history of our species”

Much deserved praise and recognition was given to the Youth Strikers represented by Hannah Mitchell of the Manchester
Climate Change Youth Board and Ishaa Asim MYP. After further speeches, a surprising amendment and a discussion on the
importance of the green economy, the motion was passed!

### Manchester Council Declares Climate Emergency

Here's XR member Claire's account of the highs - and subsequent frustrating lows - of this momentous day.

_09.45 Wednesday. Town Hall Portico, Manchester City Centre._

![Campaigners at town meeting, one holding a sign saying Climate Emergency Please Now Act]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/newsletters/20190717/climate-emergency-please-now-act.jpg)

About 50 or so campaigners gather at the front entrance of the town hall extension ready to attend the Climate Emergency
vote being proposed by councillors Annette Wright and Eve Holt.

Chorlton councillor Holt had started working on the motion back in January – but was dropped swiftly when it seemed 
there was lack of support inside the Labour party (aka the council, given Labour’s 93-3 majority over Lib Dems).

In June we heard that it had been revived, and a campaign began, neatly corralled by Climate Emergency Manchester who've
gathered more than 2,000 signatures on a petition calling for the emergency, for people to contact their councillors to 
urge them to support it, and to push for key elements to be added to the motion.

(It does not pass me by that "ruler" Richard Leese is one of the new motion's signatories – I can’t help be curious at
what prompted his decision to back and whether it changed the tune of those who previously didn't, and wonder what it
was that persuaded him to do so…..prize for best guess!)

We troop up to floor 3 and the public gallery – noting there’s a security guard asking for ID on the door to floor 2’s 
press gallery and access to the chamber.

The agenda has been re-arranged so the motion is heard at the top of the meeting, which seems a suitable approach for
**An Emergency**.

Wright and Holt make brilliant, impassioned speeches met with standing ovations from the benches and galleries, Mandie 
Shilton Godwin makes a crucial interjection from the floor spelling out what councillors will need to do, and Lib Dem’s
young councillor Richard Kirkpatrick chips in with an amendment that is accepted without demure (unheard of!) to pull 
the carbon-zero target date back to 2030, and add a provision for the council to push the GM Pension Fund to divest 
from fossil fuel.

On the floor of the chamber are 40 or so school children, some littlies and some teens, standing with banners and 
placards which they hold facing the councillors in a ‘horseshoe of hope’.

![Placard stating Please be bolder]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/newsletters/20190717/climate-emergency-please-be-bolder.jpg)

> Our Future in Your Hands
>
> Act Now!
>
> Join the Pollution Solution!
>
> Please Reduce CO2

Youth MP Ishaa Asim and another pupil are invited to the podium to address the council with powerful words.

The energy in the huge room – already hot when we arrived – is electric and the public in the ceiling gallery are 
sweating and breathless with excitement … (and an over-enthusiastic thermostat).

There are no objections. There is no point-scoring. There are only 96 democratically elected people doing their duty 
and doing it well.

The motion is carried and we applaud and we whistle and I have a lump in my throat.

In here, for this half an hour, the world IS reacting to the facts in a way those facts merit, we ARE going to do this!

I leave the chamber and pause to write a post on Facebook and Twitter.

I check the @mancitycouncil feed – nothing. Oh, perhaps they’re outside with councillors and pupils getting photos? 
Coz I assume the council have briefed them and teed up some coverage of this historic day?

I check the Manchester Evening News Twitter feed – nothing. Strange? I think – as I added the Newsdesk to my tweets. 
How easy is a simple retweet?

But by 3pm – four hours after ‘The Emergency’ was declared – still seemingly nothing on any media outlet – or the 
council’s own channels.

Our Manchester media, it seems, have not quite cottoned on to what ‘Emergency’ means.

So reality dawns – the council’s own press office has failed to cover it’s own Emergency – there is no press release, 
no imagery, no quotes, no clarification of what the motion means.

For instance – councillor’s Kirkpatrick’s amendment seemingly means that the city is now committed to 2030 not 2038 and 
seems a hugely significant point – but it is a not even recorded anywhere officially.

What’s the saying – if no-one sees it – has it happened?

This is what I feel like as I sit at home wondering whether I dreamt the whole episode.

I pick up my phone and call the MEN newsdesk.

I get a call back from a journalist who is apparently writing up the story by reviewing the live feed of the meeting.

I give her background, I give her some quotes. I send her photos. I send her a video of the crowd cheering the motion
being passed (which has had nearly 2,000 views simply from being shared from my own lowly Facebook page).

No story ever appears.

I’ve no doubt the council’s lack of action has not helped.

I send an email to the council’s Head of Communications.

I haven’t had a reply by the time of writing this, not that I expected one in that time given that I’d asked a number 
of questions.

But magically, two full days after **‘the Emergency’**, a piece appears on the council’s website (somewhat misleadingly 
badged with the date Wednesday 10th which may be when it was written but most certainly wasn’t when it was published, 
and I know because I’d checked multiple times in the previous 48 hours).

I’m so upset that the only places this event – an Emergency! – seem to have been recorded at the time are on personal 
social media and campaign accounts and websites (e.g. Extinction Rebellion, Friends of the Earth).

Councillor Holt manages to get hold of the speeches, edit them herself so she and Councillor Wright can publish on a 
personal YouTube page – the only mildly curated record of their epic calls to action.

Clearly, our climate and environmental crisis requires huge change – and such change can only come about with an 
engaged and active media. Yet the media outlets in Manchester seem to be virtually ignoring this agenda.

This communication and content failure is a matter of huge concern that any self respecting media professional in the 
city – wherever they work – cannot let continue.

## Bee in your bonnet

In our last instalment of the Cap and Share debate, Paul Harnett responds to Grahame and Elliot’s last comment.
Next week, we’ll address some of your comments on one of last week’s items.

> You are absolutely right - getting world governments to agree on a cap will be very difficult given present 
> circumstances but the point stands, it is the most effective way to hit zero carbon in the next few years.  
> Present circumstances see governments happy to subsidise the burning of carbon to the tune of about $5.2 trillion/year
> &ndash; so we are completely in the wrong situation to hit any targets.
>
> As for lobbying against, you are absolutely right - but the fossil fuel producers already have put aside funds to 
> prepare for significant taxes on Carbon. They are even lobbying for significant taxes on Carbon and it is now the
> situation that Green New Deal is seen as in opposition to taxes, especially in the USA but also in other countries.  
> There is no reason why you can't have a Green New Deal AND taxes/cap.  And your argument against a cap is exactly the 
> same as why taxes country by country won't work (and the carbon producers know this) - they will move operations, HQs,
> etc around the world to avoid taxes as far as possible - and the zero carbon targets will be lost again.
>
> So - if we got a few likeminded states to look for beneficial agreements (like Paris?) I suspect we would end up in 
> the same position, all piecemeal without decent enforcement.
>
> Also agree that capping carbon without preparing for transition would be disastrous, hence the view that a Green New 
> Deal should also be entered into. A massive retrofit of housing and investment into public transport, for example. 
> These would take governments to abandon the neoliberal orthodoxy of the present.  But also do not forget that prices 
> are still powerful signals.  If Carbon goes up in price then some - not all- transitions will occur naturally, e.g. 
> the vast number of journeys under 2 miles would suddenly drop as people take to bikes and walking.
>
> You are also right that UBI need not come from Carbon; there are many other potential sources, but the argument is 
> that it should come from the commons (however you define that) - and a basic commons is the air we breathe - so highly
> appropriate that it should come from pollution of the air (as well as other commons).
>
> The basic argument is that we have an international problem and we need an international solution - hence the 
> international rebellion!
