excerpt: A poem by Simon Armitage
---
They sent out a dove\
It wobbled home, wings slicked in a rainbow of oil\
A sprig of tinsel snagged in its beak\
A yard of fishing line binding its feet

Bring back\
Bring back the leaf

They sent out an arctic fox\
It plodded the bays of the Northern fringe\
In muddy socks and a nylon cape

Bring back\
Bring back the leaf

Bring back the reed and the reef\
Set the ice sheet back on its frozen plinth\
Tuck the restless water course into its bed\
Sit the glacier down on its highland throne\
Put the snow-cap back on the mountain peak\
Let the Northern lights be the Northern lights\
    Not the alien glow over Glasgow or Leeds

A camel capsized in a tropical flood\
Caimans dozed in Antarctic lakes\
Polymers rolled in the sturgeon’s blood\
Hippos wandered the housing estates

Bring back\
Bring back the leaf

Bring back the tusk and the horn unshorn\
Bring back the fern, the fish, the frond and the fowl\
The golden toad and the pygmy owl\
Revisit the scene where swallowtails fly\
  Through acres of unexhausted sky

They sent out a boat\
Go little breaker \
Splinter the pack ice and flows\
Nose through the rafts and pads of wrappers \
And bottles and nurdles and cans \
  Of bergs and atolls and islands and states of plastic bags and micro beads\
And the forests of smoke

Bring back\
Bring back the leaf\
Bring back the river and sea
