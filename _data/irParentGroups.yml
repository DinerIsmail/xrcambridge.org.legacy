    The activities within Action Support are, Action Design, Disability Coordination, Rebel Rider Coordination, Affinity
    Group Coordination, De-escalation and Non Violent Communciation (NVC), Police Liaison, Action Wellbeing, First Aid,
    and Debriefing.

    Actions are the non-violent direct actions that lie at the heart of XRs achievement of its aims. This parent group
    covers the coordination of affinity groups who carry out the actions and the different roles of the members of the
    affinity groups, the planning of the actions. We also need people with bikes to be a means of communication across
    the site (rebel riders). We also provide disability coordination. Careful communication with the police when
    appropriate is essential, and this is done through the police liaison group.  We also provide support in non-violent
    communication (NVC) and de-escalation when tensions and conflicts arise. It is particularly important that we
    provide for the wellbeing of those preparing for and undertaking actions. And, at the end of every action lessons
    are learned and experiences shared in the debrief.

    Not everyone will want to be involved directly in an action or be arrestable, but as you will see there are many
    vital supporting roles.

- title: Arrestee Support
  content: |-
    This covers three areas; Arrestee Support itself, Police Station Support and Advocacy. The role of arrestee support
    is to ensure that when someone is arrested we know where they are taken. Then, when they are released, we are there
    to meet them, no matter what time of day. We aim to provide around the clock service with people waiting outside
    the police stations (custody suites) to pick up the arrestees when the police release them. We listen, provide a
    phone (arrestees should have no phone or identification when arrested), provide food and ensure they are able to
    get where they need to go up to and including driving our rebels home. This can extend to support and advocacy
    within the police station. We offer support with court appearances including being able to arrange places for
    people who have to travel in from further away for court, to stay overnight. This is a vital and fulfilling
    service to our rebels.

    If you would like to help provide this service let us know at:

- title: Media and Messaging
  content: |-
    ## Social Media
    You don’t need to have a blue tick beside your name to promote XR. Do you know how to use Twitter, Facebook, 
    Instagram, Snapchat? Can you tell a story with only live feeds or within 280 characters? The social media team is 
    all about broadcasting national content, according to the non-violent strategies and passionate principles of XR. 
    If you want to tell the stories of our powerful rebels; promote the theme and message of the Northern site; gather 
    graphics for teams to share across channels or, if you’re heading south for the October Rebellion, contribute by 
    simply live-streaming as much as possible, then this is the group for you. This time, we want XR’s message to spread 
    further than it ever has before! Can you help?

    ## Press
    A role for rebels who are good with time-management and who can communicate efficiently. The role includes: liaising 
    with the media on the ground and passing updates to the Rebel Support Office (RSO); collecting information from action
    teams for press releases; making sure that the press are alerted to specific rebel or affinity group actions and to 
    important spokes/notable arrivals. People who know, confidently, what XR’s message to the world is and who can make 
    sure that the press are always in the right place, at the right time, to capture it.  

    ## Videography and Photography
    If you can tell a story using pictures or film, you’re in! In the lead up to October, we’re looking for accessible 
    content which can help to promote the message of XR and give an insight into the people - the teachers, builders, 
    doctors and hairdressers - who are preparing to take to the streets. If you’re also able to make it down to London for 
    the rebellion, then you’ll be both coordinating with others in the group, as well as using your own initiative, to 
    create videos and take pictures that document the movements and strength of our rebels who are fighting for their future.

    ## Notables
    Being British is often associated with being “too polite to ask”... but not this time. To take a role like this you 
    must be able to communicate confidently and efficiently. The role includes; finding as many connections to notables as 
    you can from fellow organisers and rebels and then passing all contact details to the RSO; greeting and accompanying 
    notables when they arrive on site; alerting the press and any other appropriate departments when notable movements arise 
    i.e. stage managers to know of upcoming speeches, videographers to know of intimate moments with rebels, action teams to 
    know if a notable wishes to be arrested, etc. 

    ## Spokes and Training
    Any experience of teaching, training or coordinating? Whether it was in a classroom, a gym or as a parent, we’re looking 
    for people who can support our trained spokespeople and coordinate with the press team. The role entails; alerting 
    spokespeople about new press enquiries and making sure that they are given all the available details when one arises; 
    keeping an organised list of people who are trained to speak to the media and being happy to take part in media training
    yourself as a reserve; being confident and passionate about explaining what XR is fighting for and why others around the 
    world should join us.

    ## Rebel Stories
    We are looking for people who are willing to share their stories. Using your voice to tell your truth at this historic time
    is the most powerful  thing you can do. We want to keep a list of people willing to share their stories as requests for 
    interviews come in. We find that these requests can be very specific so we would like some [basic information about you](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhdTO4v-cr37-xSkpbWJvrxUqwjomyFyWlgMJW6yJ7Y/mobilebasic){: target="_blank" rel="nofollower noopener noreferrer"},
    to help us get to know you better. Please be assured that this information is not shared outside of the XR Voices group

- title: Movement Support
  content: |-
    New people coming for the first time need an induction. XR is a welcoming, open movement of volunteers. There are
    important principles that we work by; we have our DNA and a rebel code of conduct that we expect everyone to follow.
    It is designed to give us the greatest chance of succeeding. Providing this induction is an important part of
    helping people to find their proper place in the movement.

    A large action like the International  Rebellion requires a considerable logistical organisation. Rota management
    is important. If this is something you are good at let us know.

    We also provide non violent direct action training. NVDA is at the heart of what we do. It is important to
    undertaker this training and we also need people willing to give the training.

    Leafleting and outreach is another core activity. The success of XR requires that we grow and that we bring the
    support of as many people as possible with us. We do a lot of leafleting and always need people to do this. This
    can involve talking to people and particularly seeking to understand and support. It is not about protolyzing. If
    you are good with people and like chatting leafleting is a lot of fun. Outreach also includes more formal
    presentations of the science and aims of XR. This can be to schools, university groups, faith groups, political
    parties, LGBT groups, meeting open to all. There is no end to this. There is training in our Heading for Extinction
    – and what to do about it – talk. If want to be involved in this vital activity let us know.

    People's assemblies: XR calls for a Citizens Assembly as part of it demands and they operate rather like a jury.
    Peoples Assemblies are held on site and are open forums to discuss events and actions. Peoples Assemblies require
    coordination. Does this interest you?

    A steward at a Rebellion is a fulfilling and sometimes demanding role. But everyone should take a turn at this.
    You need to be responsive, friendly and calm. A major part of this role is talking to people.  The function of
    stewards is to ensure a safe, healthy & controlled environment for all those on-site, on processions, marches and
    during actions. Steward prevent overcrowding and watch for any hazards that could cause harm to someone attending
    the action. Stewards do not intervene is dangerous situations – they escalate any issues to the appropriate contacts
    (e.g. XR, medical, or police). Stewards reach out to the local population to communicate the objectives and
    principles of XR, including the police.

    We also provide training on dealing with conflicts and tension. And have people on site able to provide these
    skills. If this is an area you are interested in – again – let us know.

- title: World Building and Production
  content: |-
    The International Rebellion is a huge physical undertaking. Designing and building the site in London requires
    considerable planning and coordination. A thousand things have to come together, including planning the sites and
    mapping out the services, sourcing tents and marquees, programming talks, finding bands, scheduling the music and
    other events, carrying out creative actions – you have probably seen the Red Brigade street performances for
    example. We must also provide sound and power, sanitation and waste management, Build and run the kitchens, source
    food and cooking it for a 24/7 service to our rebels and the public. We must transport the materials and store them,
    coordinate the camp logistics, manage the wellbeing hubs and ensure that families are properly supported. Then
    take it down at the end and clean up. It is fun and tiring and very satisfying. If this appeals to you let us
    know at xrworldsnorth@gmail.com.

    And don’t forget we need as many people as possible at the start to put it all together.

    of between 60-200 Ah, which owners of campervan, motorbikes and boats will often own. We are looking for as many 
    as possible for energy storage on-site in October. Please direct all offers and replies to a.n.urwick@gmail.com.

    We’re feeling ambitious and we hope you are too; for what would the wild be without its wildlife? The two costume 
    themes will be ’The Birds and the Bees’ and ‘Northern Forest’, Let us flex our creative Northern muscles and get as 
    many of our rebels striped, spotted, feathered and furred as possible. Additionally any props, banners, decorations, 
    placards and artwork that you can bring or make to fit with this theme will help to make our forest a thriving hub of 
    biodiversity, with the potential to put a smile on the face of even the most sour-faced dawn commuter.

    If you don't want to design your own costume, you can contact [xrworldsnorth@gmail.com](mailto:xrworldsnorth@gmail.com) to help out with one of the 7 
    giant origami animal-heads that we have acquired for the ‘Northern Forest’ theme, they will send you a downloadable pdf 
    to print at home.

    to make our Northern Forest a thriving hub of biodiversity, with the potential to put a smile on the face of dawn commuters.
