  answer: |-

- question: Will I get arrested if I participate in an action?
  answer: |-
    Prior to the event, the group undertaking the action will discuss whether the action poses a risk of getting arrested.

    If there is a risk, the action coordinator will make sure everyone taking part is informed and comfortable.

- question: What if I don't want to or can't get arrested?
  answer: |-
    Some people may be arrestable, but have boundaries in terms of what they are happy to be arrested for. 
    This might be based on the possible sentence (e.g. someone might be happy to be arrested for an action that carries a fine, 
    but not for one that has risk of a prison sentence) or on the nature of the action itself. 

    It is important to understand these boundaries before embarking on any action. 

- question: What if I decide I'm uncomfortable with the action after it starts?
  answer: |-
    First of all, don't panic! This is perfectly normal.

    During each action, we do frequent ‘check-ins’ and we agree a clear code for someone
    to use if they become uncomfortable at any stage. 

    Generally, the wellbeing person or group co-ordinator will take responsibility for ensuring that 
    check-ins take place during an action/protest/demonstration. You can withdraw your participation
    at any time.

- question: Are legal observers present during actions?
  answer: |-
    Yes.

    If undertaking an arrestable action, it is important to have legal observers present.

    Anyone can have legal observer training.

- question: What happens at the end of an action?
  answer: |-
    It's important to 'check-out' at the end of an action.

    This is a quick debrief to see how everyone is feeling and is a really important way to
    check whether everyone feels comfortable with the action just taken and to flag
    where further support may be useful. 

    A fuller evaluation, often done a few days later, is also a good opportunity to discuss how everything went, 
    including how successful communication and wellbeing during the action was, as well as how smoothly the logistics ran.
