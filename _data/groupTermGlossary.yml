- question: Local Group (LG)
  answer: |-
    A group of people who create an Extinction Rebellion (XR) presence in a local area. 
    They build support within their communities through local outreach and actions. 
    They are decentralised and as long as they adhere to the 
    [ten values and principles](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/), they can be XR. 
    When local groups are big enough they may set up working groups in order to organise more effectively.

- question: Working Group (WG)
  answer: |-
    Working groups focus on specific areas of work. Some working groups are permanent, and others may arise 
    to organise specific actions, and then dissolve again once they are no longer needed. 
    Some of the permanent working groups we have are the following

    - Actions Anchor Group
    - Media & Messaging
    - Training and Outreach
    - Systems & Tech
    - Political Strategy
    - Regenerative Culture
    - Arts

    An example of a temporary working group is the one which organised the Northern Rebellion.

- question: Coordination Group (CG)
  answer: |-
    A coordination group is a small group of people from each working group who help to ensure 
    that communication between the working groups is maintained.

- question: Affinity Groups (AG)
  answer: |-
    Affinity groups are for non-violent direct actions, comprising of people doing the actions 
    and their support system. AGs consist of 8-12 people and are completely autonomous in deciding 
    which actions to carry out, as long as they adhere to the [ten values and principles](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/). 
    They exist as part of our regenerative culture where we take time to pause and reflect, 
    and are a group of close-knit people who support each other both in and out of actions.

- question: Regional Group (RG)
  answer: |-
    A regional group is designed to support the growth of XR in a particular region of the country. 
    For example, XR Cambridge is supporting growth in Greater Cambridge. 
    The group may become defunct once [Local Groups](/local-groups) are fully established.
