- question: Can I join?
  answer: |-
    Yes!

    Extinction Rebellion is made up of people of all ages and backgrounds from all over the world. From under 18 to
    over 80 year olds – there are thousands of people willing to put their liberty on the line to fight the climate
    and ecological emergency and protect biodiversity and atmospheric health.

    We don’t align with any political party and welcome people who vote for all political parties and none.

    As long as you agree with and respect our values and principles, you are welcome to attend general meetings, join working groups, join affinity groups, or just attend actions. Any level of involvement is appreciated. Whatever you have to offer, a better future needs it.

- question: Are you really grassroots?
  answer: |-
    Yes. We are ordinary people who care deeply about the world and want to do whatever we can peacefully to stop the destruction of Life on Earth and the deep injustices we see, and to push for the better, fairer and more beautiful world that we all want to see. No one controls us or tells us what to do.

- question: Aren't you just a group of middle-class left-wing activists?

    We are working to improve diversity in our movement. We don’t think it is helpful to set this up as a fight between the “left” and the “right”, we have an enormous challenge before us, we believe we need to lay down our differences and find our common ground.

- question: Do you think you will win?
  answer: |-
    We don’t know if we will but we can no longer stand by and act as if the future doesn’t matter. World leaders have failed to adequately confront the emergency and polite lobbying, marching, voting, consumer- and shareholder-activism, have all failed to achieve meaningful change

    We are now on the brink and the only option left is civil disobedience, to disrupt the ordinary working of things, so that decision makers HAVE to take notice.

    We believe we have succeeded in increasing the conversation about the depth of crisis.

- question: What is your structure, how do you organise?
  answer: |-
    We are a decentralised organisation – anyone can do things in the name of Extinction Rebellion if they agree with
    and adhere to our principles and values – people don’t need anyone’s permission on that basis.

    We have a self-organising system. Power is invested in roles through the use of mandates rather than held by
    people. It is a creative system that grows in response to the organisations needs.

    In Cambridge, we are organised in affinity groups and working groups.
    - Affinity groups (AGs) are groups of around 10 people who  support each other, discuss actions and ideas and receive wider information about what's going on. We recommend that you first do a [Non-Violent Direct Action training](/events), and then join an existing AG or a newly formed one at the training.
    - Working groups have been set up to oversee, coordinate or organise certain areas of Extinction Rebellion Cambridge. Anyone can join a working group - you don't need to be NVDA trained. To join or find out more visit the [Get Involved page](/get_involved).
