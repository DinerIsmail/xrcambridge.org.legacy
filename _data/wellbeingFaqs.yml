- question: Has everyone had wellbeing and regenerative culture training?
  answer: |-
    Wellbeing and regenerative culture training is where you learn the facts and skills on how to 
    support yourself and one another during an action. It is not just for those taking on a 
    designated wellbeing role within the affinity group. Self-care during and after actions 
    is a central part of the training.
