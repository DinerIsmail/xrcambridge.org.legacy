- question: I want to find out more about Extinction Rebellion and what it's all about
  answer: |-
    Extinction Rebellion is run entirely by volunteers giving up their spare time.

    To stay in touch with news and details of events we are running, join the Extinction Rebellion mailing list by [signing up here](/signup "Sign up").

    We hold regular meetings, talks and training in central Manchester - check our [events page](/events) for more information.

    To find out more about how XR MCR is organised, head on over to our [general FAQs page](/frequently-asked-questions).

- question: How can I get involved in my local area?
  answer: |-
    Join an XR Local Group!

    For many people a local group is where interest in XR will be best focused - 
    working with other people in your local area to plan actions and outreach that are relevant to you and your local community.

    New XR Local Groups are forming all the time. If there's not a Local Group in your area yet, come along to our
    Monday meetings to meet other people to get something started.

- question: I've never had any experience of being an activist. Am I allowed to join?
  answer: |-
    Anyone can take action in the name of XR - you just need to [sign up to the 10 principles](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/ "10 principles") 
    especially non-violence, and focus on [XR’s 3 demands](https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/ "3 Demands"), 
    and find a couple of other people who agree with you to act with you.

- question: I want to take my interest further and can commit some free time. How can I get started?
  answer: |-
    Join an XR Working Group!

    A Working Group is a central group of rebels contributing more specalised skills to XR. 
    They work together on a particular theme or idea, for example the "media" working group will 
    be responsible for liaising with the media. Each working group operates autonomously and organises 
    its own mandate and activities.

    We have the following Working Groups who are actively looking for people who can get involved and help grow XR in Manchester.

    - Actions
    - Arts
    - Media
    - Training and Outreach
    - Regenerative Culture
    - Growing Resistance

    We are looking for volunteers for every working group - people who are able to give some regular time and commit to regular meetings (online or face to face) and take on tasks - its a great way to meet new friends and learn new skills.

    We organise work via a tool called Slack, where there are lots of other channels for smaller topics of interest.

    Head over to our [get-involved](/get_involved) to get in touch with any of the Working Groups to offer your skills and time.
